# Terraform tutorial

## What Is Terraform?

Terraform is one of the most popular Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool, used by DevOps teams to automate infrastructure tasks. It is used to automate the provisioning of your cloud resources. Terraform is an open-source, cloud-agnostic provisioning tool developed by HashiCorp and written in GO language.

## Terraform Lifecycle

Terraform lifecycle consists of â€“ **init**, **plan**, **apply**, and **destroy**.

![Terraform life cycle](https://github.com/srirymec/devops-sre-learning/blob/main/terraform/terraform-lifecycle.png)

- **terraform init** initializes the (local) Terraform environment. Usually executed only once per session.
- **terraform plan** compares the Terraform state with the as-is state in the cloud, build and display an execution plan. This does not change the deployment (read-only).
- **terraform apply** executes the plan. This potentially changes the deployment.
- **terraform destroy** deletes all resources that are governed by this specific terraform environment.

## Terraform Core Concepts

- **Variables:** Terraform has input and output variables, it is a key-value pair.<br/>

  **Supported variable types**

  > - string 
  > - number 
  > - bool 
  > - any 
  > - list 
  > - map 
  > - object 
  > - tuple 
  
- **Provider:** Terraform users provision their infrastructure on the major cloud providers such as AWS, Azure, OCI, and others. A provider is a plugin that interacts with the various APIs required to create, update, and delete various resources.
  ```
  Terraform { 
    required_providers { 
         local = { 
             source = "hashicorp/local" 
             version = "1.4.0" ("!=2.0.0" | "< 1.4.0" | "> 1.1.0" | "> 1.2.0, < 2.0.0, != 1.4.0"| "~> 1.2") 
         } 
     } 
  }
  ```

  ```
  terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 4.0"
    }
   }
  }
  ```
  
- **Module:** Any set of Terraform configuration files in a folder is a module.

  **Module ec2**
  > **main.tf**
  > ```
  > resource "aws_instance" "my_ec2" {
  >  name = var.name
  >  ------
  >  ------
  > }
  > ```
  > 
  > **variables.tf**
  > ```
  > variable "name" {}
  > variable "instance_type" {}
  > variable "subnet_id" {}
  > variable "ec2-sg" {}
  > ```
  >
  > **outputs.tf**
  > ```
  > output "private_dns" {
  >   value = aws_instance.my_ec2.private_dns
  > }
  > ```
  >

   **Client class**
  > **ec2.tf**
  > ```
  > module ec2 {
  >   source = "./../modules/ec2"
  >   name = var.name
  >   -------
  >   -------
  > }
  > ```
  > 
  > **variables.tf**
  > ```
  > variable "name" {}
  > variable "instance_type" {}
  > variable "subnet_id" {}
  > variable "ec2-sg" {}
  > ```
  >
  > **providers.tf**
  > ```
  > terraform {
  >   required_providers {
  >     aws = {
  >     source  = "hashicorp/aws"
  >     version = "~> 4.0"
  >    }
  >   }
  >
  >   backend "s3" {
  >     bucket         = "srini-test-123"
  >     key            = "terraform.tfstate"
  >     region         = "us-east-1"
  >   }
  > }
  > ```
  >
  > **variables.tfvars**
  > ```
  > name = "srini-test-instance"
  > instance_type = "t2.micro"
  > ------
  > ------
  > ```

- **State:** Terraform records information about what infrastructure is created in a Terraform state file. The state file is created **only after the apply is run atleast once**.
- **Resources:** Cloud Providers provides various services in their offerings, they are referenced as Resources in Terraform. 
- **Data Source:** Data source performs a read-only operation. It allows data to be fetched or computed from resources/entities that are not defined or managed by Terraform or the current Terraform configuration.
- **Plan:** It is one of the stages in the Terraform lifecycle where it determines what needs to be created, updated, or destroyed to move from the real/current state of the infrastructure to the desired state.
- **Apply:** It is one of the stages in the Terraform lifecycle where it applies the changes real/current state of the infrastructure in order to achieve the desired state.

## Terraform Configuration Files

- **Configuration file (*.tf files):** Here we declare the provider and resources to be deployed along with the type of resource and all resources specific settings
- **Variable declaration file (variables.tf or variables.tf.json):** Here we declare the input variables required to provision resources
- **Variable definition files (terraform.tfvars):** Here we assign values to the input variables
- **State file (terraform.tfstate):** a state file is created once after Terraform is run. It stores state about our managed infrastructure.

**variables.tf**
  ```
  variable "prefix" { 
     default = ["Mr", "Mrs", "Sir"] 
      type = list 
  } 
 
  variable "length" { 
     default = 2 
     type = number 
     description = "" 
  } 
  ```

  **main.tf**
  ```
  resource "random_pet" "mypet"{ 
     prefix = var.prefix[0] 
     length = var.length 
  }
  ```

  **If you want to use the output generated by one resource as input to other:**
 
  ${random_pet.mypet.id} ---> Since random_pet returns the id of the pet created. 

  **outputs.tf**
  ```
  output pet-name { 
     value = random_pet.mypet.id 
     description = "record the value of random_pet generated" 
  }
  ```

  After terraform apply, the output variables with value is printed on the console. 
  We can also see the output variables list with values using the command,<br/>
  **terraform output**

## Terraform lifecycle management

- **create_before_destroy:** If set to true, new resource to be created first, then older one to be deleted.
  ```
  resource "local_file" "pet"{ 
    filename = "/var/tmp/pets.txt" 
    content = "we love pets" 
 
    lifecycle { 
        create_before_destroy = true 
    } 
  }
  ```
  
- **prevent_destroy:** Prevents resource deletion when config is changed and terraform apply is run. The resource can still be deleted if **terraform destroy** is used.
  ```
  resource "local_file" "pet"{ 
    filename = "/var/tmp/pets.txt" 
    content = "we love pets" 
 
    lifecycle { 
        prevent_destroy = true 
    } 
  } 
  ```
  
- **ignore_changes:** Accepts a list of valid attributes in the resource to ignore the changes made outside terraform (manually or cli)
  ```
  resource "aws_instance" "webserver" { 
     ami = "ami---" 
     instance_type = "t2.micro" 
     tags = { 
           Name = "ProjectA-webserver" 
     } 
 
    lifecycle { 
        ignore_changes = [ tags/all ] 
    } 
  }
  ```

## Terraform Data Source

Manage resources created outside terraform. <br/>
Use keyword **data**

```
data "aws_ami" "example" {
  most_recent = true

  owners = ["self"]
  tags = {
    Name   = "app-server"
    Tested = "true"
  }
}

```

## Resource vs Data Source

|    Resource                       |    Data Source   |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Keyword: resource                 | Keyword: data    |
| Creates, updates, destroys infra  | Only reads infra |

## Terraform remote state and state locking

If we have the state file locally, other users who work on the code will not have the latest state file with them which may cause conflicts. It's not good either to have the state file in git repo as git does not provide state locking, also every time user may not git pull, that means the users may not have the latest state file. 
 
**State locking** is very important to avoid concurrency. Two users working on same code if the state is not locked, may lead to conflicts. 

**Terraform backend to specify the remote state location:**

```
terraform { 
    backend "s3" { 
         bucket = "<bucket-name>" 
         key       = "<dir-name>" 
         region  = "us-east-1" 
         dynamodb_table = "state-locking" 
    } 
}
```
## Manipulating terraform state

This operation is strictly restricted. Do not use unless no other option. 
 
```terraform state show <path-to-state-file>```
 
**Other subcommands:**

| Sub Command      |               Description                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| list             | List resources in the state                 |
| pull             | Pull current state and output to stdout     |
| push             | Update remote state from a local state file |
| show             | Show a resource in the state                |
|  mv              | Move an item in the state                   |
| replace-provider | Replace provider in the state               |

## Iterating - terraform for-each

**variables.tf**
```
variable "users" { 
    type = set(string) 
} 
variable "content" { 
    default = "password: S3cr3tP@ssw0rd" 
   
} 
```

**main.tf**
```
resource "local_file" "name" { 
    filename = each.value 
    sensitive_content = var.content 
    for_each var.users 
}
```

## Terraform Conditional expressions

|   Expression  |               Description              |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------|
|    **&&**     | Both should be true - result is true   |
|    **&#124;&#124;**     | Either should be true - result is true |
|    **!**      | Negation                               |

## Conditonal Operator

```Condition ? <true_val> : <false_val>```

## If else

```
If <> 
   then 
      <> 
   else 
      <> 
fi 

```
