| Topic              | Docker                                                                                     | Kubernetes                                                                                  |

| **Function**        | Docker is a tool that packages applications into containers for consistent behavior.       | Kubernetes automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.  |
| **Key Features**    | - **Containerization**: Packages apps into standardized units.                            | - **Container Orchestration**: Manages containers across multiple machines.                 |
|                    | - **Portability**: Containers run on any system with Docker support.                        | - **Scaling**: Dynamically adjusts resources based on demand.                               |
|                    | - **Resource Efficiency**: Containers share the host OS kernel.                            | - **Self-Healing**: Automatically restarts failed containers and redeploys them.             |
|                    | - **Development Focus**: Tools for building, testing, and deploying containers.            | - **Automation**: Automates operational tasks like deployment and scaling.                  |
| **When to Use**     | Ideal for developing, testing, and deploying individual applications or services.         | Best for complex, large-scale applications with many containers and high availability needs. |
| **Scope**           | Focuses on individual containers and their development.                                    | Focuses on orchestrating and managing clusters of containers.                               |
| **Complexity**      | Simpler to set up and use, focused on single-container applications.                       | More complex, requires knowledge of container orchestration and cluster management.        |
| **Use Cases**       | Used for developing and testing applications.                                              | Used for deploying and managing applications in production, especially at scale.            |
