# üõ†Ô∏è Introduction to Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

---

## üîç Understanding the Modern Software Landscape

- Organizations are split:
  - Some focus on **speed, agility, and time-to-market**.
  - Others focus on **stability and predictability**.
  
- In standard software development:
  - **Businesses**, **developers**, and **operations** often work in silos.
  - Goals are misaligned:
    - Businesses & Developers ‚Üí want **new features fast**.
    - Customers & Operations ‚Üí want **stability and dependability**.

---

## ü§ù Bridging the Gap with SRE

- SRE addresses these challenges by implementing **DevOps practices** effectively.
- Key characteristics:
  - **Small, frequent changes** in production.
  - **Agile + DevOps** principles drive faster delivery.
  - Pressure for:
    - Higher **availability expectations**.
    - Faster **issue resolution**.
    - Lower **operational budgets**.
  - Cost arbitrage through labor is no longer viable.

## üìö Origin of SRE

- Developed at **Google in 2003**.
- Made public in **2016**.
- Gained widespread **popularity and adoption** since then.
- Helps balance:
  - **Velocity of changes**
  - **Reliability**
  - **Stability**
  - **Performance**
- Focuses on **automation** and **modern architectures**.
- **40-90%** of system costs occur **post-deployment**.

## üìñ What is SRE?

> **Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** is a discipline that applies **software engineering** principles to **infrastructure and operations**, aiming to build **ultra-scalable and highly reliable** software systems.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Cultural change** challenging conventional IT wisdom.
- Combines **software** and **systems engineering**.
- **Empowers SREs** to:
  - Manage **error budgets**.
  - Handle **toil reduction**.

---

## üë• Empowering SRE Teams

- Avoid overloading SREs with **operational duties**.
- **Distribute task load** across the team.
- Organizations need:
  - Skilled **software** and **systems engineers**.
  - **Collaborative** operations resources.
- Easier to scale by hiring **complementary skilled people** rather than one with all skills.
- Ideal team structure: **50/50 mix** of software and systems engineers.

---

## üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Blameless Culture

- **Blameless postmortems** for incidents.
- Focus on:
  - **Systemic causes**, not individuals.
  - Supporting people in making the right decisions.
- Emphasize: **Human errors are system problems**.

---

## üß¨ SRE, DevOps, and Agile

- **SRE** is an **implementation of DevOps**.
- Optimizes **reliability through engineering and operations**.
- Works across the **entire software lifecycle**.
- **Agile** ‚Üí Improves business-dev collaboration.
- **CI/CD** ‚Üí Enables rapid, quality feedback and delivery.
- **DevOps** ‚Üí Automates delivery pipeline.
- **SRE** ‚Üí Focuses on **production insights**, **operational improvements**.

## üîÅ SRE in the SDLC Phases

| Phase        | SRE Activities                                                                 |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Plan**     | Toil reduction, resilience planning using automation                            |
| **Build**    | Performance tuning, system analysis, customer behavior understanding            |
| **Test**     | Chaos engineering, performance testing                                           |
| **Release**  | Release optimization, support for product launches                              |
| **Operate**  | Blameless postmortems, observability, SLIs/SLOs management, error budgets       |

## üß± 5 Core Tenets of SRE

1. **Improve Reliability**
   - Ensure systems meet customer and business expectations.

2. **Identify and Reduce Toil**
   - Eliminate repetitive, manual tasks using automation.

3. **Define Target Reliability (SLOs)**
   - Set measurable goals for service reliability.

4. **Improve Observability**
   - Infer internal system state from external outputs.

5. **Practice Chaos Engineering**
   - Test system resilience through controlled experiments.
